This library is an attempt to make the **fastest possible memoization library in
JavaScript that supports *N* arguments**.

There are already very popular solutions for this problem, but they are **not
very fast enough** or accept **only one argument**.

## Installation

To use the library, install it through [npm](https://npmjs.com)

```shell
npm install fast-memoize
```

To port it to Browser or any other (non CJS) environment, use your favorite CJS
bundler. No favorite yet? Try: [Browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[Webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake) or
[Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

## Usage

```js
const memoize = require('fast-memoize')

const fn = function (one, two, three) { /* ... */ };

memoized = memoize(fn);

memoized('foo', 3, 'bar');
memoized('foo', 3, 'bar'); // Cache hit
```

## Benchmark

There is already plenty of libraries that does memoization on JS world.
[underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) and [lodash](https://lodash.com) provides
it, but they don't accept more than one argument.
[memoizee](https://www.npmjs.com/package/memoizee) is a very well written
library that supports *N* arguments, but is not even close on performance to
[lodash](https://lodash.com).

Below you can see a performance benchmark between some of the most popular libraries
for memoization.

[fast-memoize](https://github.com/caiogondim/fast-memoize) is faster than any
other library but [lodash](https://lodash.com). The reason why is that
[lodash](https://lodash.com) does not support *N* arguments and is very
optimized to that unique use case. But even though, *fast-memoize* is the
library that supports *N* that comes closer to it.

To run the benchmark, clone the repo, install the dependencies and run `npm run benchmark`.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:caiogondim/fast-memoize.git
cd fast-memoize
npm install
npm run benchmark
```
